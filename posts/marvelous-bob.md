# Stories that stick with you, Marvelous Bob

Long ago in the early 2000s, I spent a fair amount of time reading comics and stories. Questionable Content, Penny Arcade and others all fall into this category.

One that will jump in my brain and require a nostalgic dopamine kick is the story of [marvelous bob](https://web.archive.org/web/20040824074752/http://unknownhero.com/). Sadly it only exists in wayback machine, the writer Michael Buonauro committed suicide in 2004, though the story is mostly done.

This story sticks with me because it cuts the fat and joy out what a super hero is. If there is a task that only you can do and that is saving people then it will drain all the joy out of every part of your life. Almost an inverse of The Boys. Whereas they grab power and wealth to the detriment of society. Bob saves society at the cost of his soul.

That being said read this, its a bit dark but its also very good.

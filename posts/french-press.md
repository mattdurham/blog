Trying to blog more often and the easiest thing to do are these short reviews.

Today its the [Espro French Press](https://www.amazon.com/ESPRO-P3-French-Press-Micro-Filtered/dp/B011WTM622/ref=sr_1_3?crid=WKFBY2XS50ZY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZlxZH345xQklc_x92n-bqbiGJiuEGd6Jp0zsOwrGdXzUQQgej_YziMBHngR_Xf2OckmiA_aAEWaDrXyvy4-WtDXw7JBhX2CrqqWTe0_K8BKDIHzvkH_wAIsbmOiIgvXz7pBgqYWeWI8MVidqJDHDfpC54kAqxrDXvMDfcl6H3Gu9HC-coScPBG7XUN2CqYfjR0jtjL8ZwUP8s8V7tODdjDQ3wRyu6l9AFMyCwdKretZ8OoJL0vIN0_1T4_d-b0sowa_gjFnR-c40kx9eLqJZ9YqOv9UVuVCJoLwtn5PgR04.taGyvrSoY6-t4jRxmmnGYRAc6LmEC4VIJZWpxwmi95E&dib_tag=se&keywords=p2+french+press&qid=1726574286&sprefix=p2+french+pres%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-3), I have used the P3/P7 for roughly 9 years. Along with my grinder and kettle it is the most used tool in my kitchen.

Every morning I make a pot of french press, is pot the right word? and everyone morning that double walled basket keeps almost all the grounds out. I recently upgraded to the P7 after the plastic on the P3 gave out. It is far to expensive for what it is, but I use it every day and expect to get a decade out of it.

Its great, buy the P3 and see if you like it. The P7 is even better but not worth the price unless your sure of it.

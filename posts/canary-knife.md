The [canary knife](https://www.amazon.com/CANARY-Cardboard-Non-Stick-Serrated-Stainless/dp/B0D2CQLVXT?th=1) is a cheap tool that I use everyday. Previously I had several very sharp, reasonably nice knifes that I used to cut open boxes and break them down. This ranged anywhere from a CRKT to actual box cutter knives. 

None of them have been as useful as this one. I have had this knife for 6 months now. The Canary will tear through boxes with ease, cut tape and while magically being unable to cut you. Its cheap, durable, and great to use. There is very little I can saw beyond that.
